  - title: Best Damn Internet...
    details: We have 1 gbps up and down, with a dedicated fiber optic connection to the internet, and a Zyxel fiber optic
    terminal / WiFi router that manages our two wifi networks: Alta Giga and Alta Blast. Giga is 5G wifi that supports gigabit speeds, Blast is conventional 802.11n wifi which 
    tops out at 155 mbps but we boosted the signal so it is 
    always perfect reception, even on the roof! Wired internet is also available and is the fastest - about 850mbps on the old PC I'm using tprpoan;a jofo test, and I think the delay due to web browser

  - title: The View
    details: We are located on Calle Comitan on top of the hill, just past Isabel Catolica. Our facility was designed by a serious architect who took maximum advantage of the spectacular scenery. The say a picture shows 1000 words so click here...
    
  - title: Something For Everyone
    details: Whether you have lived in Sancris all your life and need aa dedicated office space for the next 6 months, or you're off to Antigua Guatemala tomorrow and want to download a few movies to watch on the bus, we have the right package for you: day / week / month which provide unlimited use of the coworking space, the rooftop terrace, and the Kokontik Cafe (which right now is coca cola in the fridge and a few  bags of chipts). We are introducing dedicated desks / office space in January, after we have set up the space - there's probably 800 square feet. Oh yes, the WiFi - all our packages include unlimited use of the internet.
  - The Consultorium
    details: Consultoria Expat is a unique company and difficult to explain over a webpage. But let me try: an expat walks into the Alta HQ, buys a coffee at Kokontic, and pulls me aside "Hey, bartender, can you get my vehicle import permit renewed ASAAP and how do I get from Chiapas to Cancun without having to stop for any checkpoint:tOOa














































































































    
  - title: Best Damn Wifi in Town? 
    details: Default bundler is Vite, while Webpack is also supported. Choose the one you like!
footer: Internet service provided by Telmex at guaranteed speeds of 1gbps down / 500mbps up, exclusively for the use of alta customers. Full speed requires wired ethernet connection. Best Damn Wifi is capable of 300-500mbps in both directions depending on your hardware and your distance from the transmitter. However, that may be my proble BDW requires device with 5 ghz wifi; 2.4 ghz devices (b/g/n) may use our enhanced 2.4 ghz subnet at slightly lower speeds. Similarly, outdoor areas may or may not have sufficient BDW signal strength, however, the 2.4 ghz signal was boosted by a brave engineer who strangely quit the next day. It works anywhere on the property (sorry, Mike... we had no idea that cranking that dial up to 11 would set your hair on fire! And to think that your setup wasn't even needed in the end because our fiber gateway is surprisingly good quality and we were able to dial it up from a web browser lol. We really hope you are not actually reading the fine print because this is Sancris and the legal system doesn't exactly function here, so money talks. Well money or the force of arms. The motto should really be "plata o plombo" - old saying of Pablo Escobar, about how he always preferred to bribe a public official (plata), rather than shoot them (plombo). But I degress. Did you know that in Colombia the teenage boys fuck donkeys? Well I guess that's no stranger than the boy who fucked a dolphin back in 72 and then wrote a book about how amazing it was... Ciao. See you at Alta!
